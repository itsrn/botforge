# BotForge
BotForge is a simple dashboard that helps you build Discord bots without any coding.

## Under developemnt
BotForge is a new project of mine and is not currently stable. You can view the roadmap of the project [here](https://github.com/users/itsrn/projects/1/views/1). If you are using one of the beta releases please report any issues found in the [`issues` ](https://github.com/itsrn/botforge/issues) tab so I'll try to fix them in the next updates.

## Contributions
Contributions for this project are welcome! If you've got an idea you want to suggest you can open an issue about it. If you've found any problems with the code and fixed them, open a pull request! (or report them through an issue).
